# Philips PE1542 Modification

This power supply origianly came with analog meters which are perfect but unfortantly for me one of them broke.

I deicded to replace all 3 with some cheap Volt/Am meters from ebay.

I have also created a video documentmenting the modification, please click on the link below to watch it.
