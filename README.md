# Philips PE1542 Modification

This power supply origianly came with analog meters which are perfect but unfortantly for me one of them broke.

I deicded to replace all 3 with some cheap Volt/Am meters from ebay.

I have also created a video documentmenting the modification, please click on the image below to watch it.

In the video I have used meters with 3 decmials precision, but the sampling rate on these were increadbly slow, I later switched to meters with 2 decmicals precision which were faster. I suspect that these meters contain a intergrating ADC, hence the slow updating times.


I have attached the 3D models incase anyone would like to perform the same modification.
